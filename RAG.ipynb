Give yourself time to absorb the information.\\n\\n3. **Seek Support**: Share your feelings with friends, family, or a support group. You may feel lonely, but remember that there are people who care about you and want to help.\\n\\n4. **Practice Self-Care**: You may feel out of control or unable to care for yourself. Try to maintain a healthy routine and ask for help when you need it.\\n\\n5. **Find Hope**: Many people feel a sense of hope once they accept their diagnosis. This hope can come from various sources, such as support from loved ones, faith, or trust in your medical team.\\n\\n6. **Communicate with Your Healthcare Team**: Express your feelings and concerns to your doctors.

      "Learning that you have cancer can come as a shock. How did you react? You may \n",
      "have felt numb, frightened, or angry. You may not have believed what the doctor \n",
      "was saying. You may have felt all alone, even if your friends and family were in \n",

      "Based on the provided context, here are some suggestions on what to do when you discover you have cancer:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Acknowledge and Accept Your Feelings**: Understand that feelings of shock, numbness, fear, anger, or disbelief are normal. It's also normal for these feelings to change often.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Take Time to Process**: The first few weeks after diagnosis can be very hard. You may have trouble thinking, eating, or sleeping. Give yourself time to absorb the information.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Seek Support**: Share your feelings with friends, family, or a support group. You may feel lonely, but remember that there are people who care about you and want to help.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Practice Self-Care**: You may feel out of control or unable to care for yourself. Try to maintain a healthy routine and ask for help when you need it.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Find Hope**: Many people feel a sense of hope once they accept their diagnosis. This hope can come from various sources, such as support from loved ones, faith, or trust in your medical team.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Communicate with Your Healthcare Team**: Express your feelings and concerns to your doctors. They can provide information, reassurance, and help you make decisions about your treatment.\n"
